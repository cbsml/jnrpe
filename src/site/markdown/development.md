#Development

When you think about JNRPE from the point of view of the developer, the choices you have are:

  * Write a plugin for JNRPE to perform some particular check not yet supported by JNRPE
  * Embed JNRPE into your own software to be able to receive queries from Nagios and monitor your app internals
  * Embed jcheck_nrpe into your own software to be able to query JNRPE or NRPE
