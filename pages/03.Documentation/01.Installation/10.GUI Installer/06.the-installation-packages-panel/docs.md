This panel allows the selection of the packages you want to install. The available choices are:

* **Core** : you can't unselect this package as it is the heart of JNRPE
* **Sample Config** : a base jnrpe.ini file configuring JNRPE with just the test command.
* **Base Plugins** : the plugins package bundled with JNRPE.
* **Unix Daemon/Windows Service** : you can choose if you want JNRPE to be installed as Unix Daemon on Unix or as a Windows Service on Windows

When you are happy with the installation, click next: the summary panel will appear.
